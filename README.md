# Pose-Evaluator
As a proof-of-concept for a potential senior design project, I made a demo that uses your webcam to tell you how well it can see you based on key parts of your body. It uses Posenet to extract keypoints from the camera feed, and then uses various weights for different features of your overall pose.
